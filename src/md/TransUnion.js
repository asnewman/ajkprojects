# Enjinx - Hub, Vision, Go, and Brain (2017 TransUnion Hackathon Winner)
A credit health fitness application created for the 2017 TransUnion Hackathon. The application consists of four different parts:

**Hub** - Web application where users can get their overall credit history and information.

**Vision** - A Google Chrome extension to aid with online shopping. While shopping, it will suggest the best credit card to use to maximize credit card benefits.

**Go** - Watch OS application for notifications about credit card usages and potential risks.

**Brain** - The central API serving all components of the application.

You can see a demo of the project here:

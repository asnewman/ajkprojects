**Hello.** My name is Ashley Newman and I am software engineer from Mountain View, California. I was born in Tokyo, Japan and grew up in Hawaii. I went to California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly for short) and receive a degree in software engineering. Currently, I am a full-stack engineer at Imperfect Foods and also work on two side-projects called Rally and StockDog.

My main interests in the software engineering field are the following:
- Privacy
- Automated stock trading
- Javascript and its frameworks (React, React Native, Node, and Typescript)
- Gaming

Below you will find a description of a few of my projects, but there are more projects I have worked on displayed on my [Github page](https://github.com/asnewman).

This web app was created for the 2019 Zoo Hackathon in San Diego. Here was the motivation:

We were inspired by the efforts made by organizations that seek to end wildlife trafficking and poaching, who may wish to avoid conflicts or forge new collaborations in other groups working in the same area. We built a mobile-first web app that can be used on any device to allow organizations to learn when potentially conflicting initiatives could be taking place and contact those interested parties.

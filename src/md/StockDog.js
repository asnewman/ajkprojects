A platform to learn the basics of stock trading while competing with friends and other users around the world. While the trading money is virtual, the competition pools have an optional monetary prize pool that the winner takes. Features multiple competition modes as well as social media features for user engagement. A production version of the site can be found at [www.stockdogapp.com](www.stockdogapp.com). Please note that this production version is not fully complete and its database will be constantly cleared. Alternatively, view the demo below (the project is still in development and so only a sliver of the system is shown):

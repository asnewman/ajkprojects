StockDog is a trading platform where there is no risk, some reward. Aimed towards new traders who have both fears of losing money and missing out on making money, StockDog allows you to practice trading real stocks using virtual currency while competing with people around the world. *StockDog is currently in alpha testing phase with a handful of users.*

Originally started as a senior group project in college, this idea has blossomed into a potential startup venture that I hope to developer with my team of developers across the US. Currently, the project is a React Native mobile app supported by a Python Flask backend and a few AWS Lambda functions.
